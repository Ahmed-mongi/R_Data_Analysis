# Diabetes Risk Analysis with Health Metrics

## Overview
This project explores the relationship between health indicators and diabetes outcomes. Using a public diabetes dataset, the analysis identifies risk profiles and factors contributing to diabetes prevalence.  

## Dataset
- Key health metrics: glucose, BMI, age, insulin, blood pressure, pregnancy history  
- Target: diabetic or non-diabetic classification  
- Source: public dataset  

## Data Processing
- Handled missing and zero values through imputation and removal  
- Ensured integrity of variables for statistical analysis  
- Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) with statistical methods and visualizations  

## Analysis and Results
- **Diabetes Rate**: Higher prevalence linked to high glucose, BMI, and older age  
- **Glucose & BMI**: Diabetic patients show significantly higher averages  
- **Pregnancies**: More pregnancies correlated with increased diabetes likelihood  
- **Blood Pressure**: Rises with age, with stronger trends in diabetic patients  
- **Correlations**: Glucose, BMI, and insulin identified as key risk factors  

## Visualizations
- Bar plots: diabetes rates, glucose levels, BMI comparison  
- Scatter plots & line graphs: age vs. glucose/insulin  
- Box plots: pregnancies vs. diabetes status  

## Challenges and Limitations
- Missing and zero values required careful preprocessing  
- Dataset limited in scope, excluding lifestyle and genetic factors  
- Assumed linearity of relationships between variables  

## Conclusion
Elevated glucose, higher BMI, and older age strongly contribute to diabetes risk. Managing these health metrics can reduce risk and support better prevention strategies.  

## Future Directions
- Incorporate lifestyle, diet, and genetic data  
- Apply machine learning models for more accurate diabetes prediction  
- Use larger and more diverse datasets for improved generalization
